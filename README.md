# Data Structures & Algorithms

 Laboratory assignments and projects related to data structures. These programs were part of a semester long course taken at University.

## Details:

 An introduction to the programming and analysis of linear and non-linear internal (main store) data structures and associated algorithms. Topics include the formal notion of an algorithm, elementary time and space complexity; linear lists (such as stacks, queues, linked structures.); non-linear lists (trees, binary trees); recursion; sorting techniques (such as heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, shell sort.); searching techniques (such as binary search, binary search trees, red-black trees, hashing.); algorithm design paradigms (such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms); and applications (Uwindsor, 2016).
